# Historical development of the self-portrait and its expression



Hi, I'm Agi and today I'm going to introduce you the topic of my bachelor thesis. And that is Historical development of the self-portrait and its expression. I chose this topic because it is the closest to me and I enjoyed working on it.
This thesis deals with the course of the development of the self-portrait from the classical paintings to today's famous selfies.

First, I picked a few of my favorite photographers who do self-portraiture. For each photographer, I studied why he or she dealt with this subject, how he or she felt, how he or she created the photo. This then helped me understand the photographer better.
I placed each photographer into an art direction, describing how photography has changed.

The Selfie is also part of this work. In my opinion, a selfie and a self-portrait are different. When we take a self-portrait, it takes more time and also helps us to show emotions and express ourselves. On the other hand, selfie for me is just a quick photo to make a memory or to show how we look today.
Nowadays it is also hard to believe what is reality and what is not. People often edit selfies to make themselves look better. I think it's sad, but what can we do.

## Practical part

In the practical part of the bachelor thesis I focus on self-portraits. From the photographers selected in the theoretical part, I have chosen four photographers who are closest or most interesting to me and who inspired me to take my own self-portrait. For each of the four photographers, I based the photograph specifically on their style, idea or execution. 

After analyzing the photographers in question, it is easier for me to empathize with their feelings and work, which then reminded me of my feelings and experiences that I portrayed in the photographs. At the same time, I wanted to try a new style of self-portraiture that I don't have as much experience with. So I can say that I took the works of the artists into my own hands and my own thoughts. 

### Barbora Bálková
The first author I was inspired by is Barbora Bálková. I based my work on her work called Masks, where she shows her identity through objects glued on her face.
I created a series of four self-portraits where I show my most common emotions. These are joy, sadness, angry and fear. I think of the term "masks" as facial expressions, or also disguises. I don't think there is a need for me to hide my face directly. It's enough to show emotion. But the emotion is not always real, it is also fake. Today, a smile may show joy, but internally it doesn't have to.

### Arno Minkkinen
Another artist for my inspiration is Arno Minkkinen and his self-portraits in nature. My goal was to try and blend in with nature while engaging my story. I enjoyed this style of photography the most as I was able to spend a lot of time in nature. At the same time, after my experience I have to say that it is not easy to blend in with nature so quickly, it takes time.
The photos were taken in my favourite place in the garden, where my family and I often gathered and spent time together. For this reason I also included my mother in the photographs. The photographs thus tell the story of my favourite place and family.

### Zdeněk Lhoták
The third of the selected authors is Zdeněk Lhoták. I was inspired by photographing the details of my body while maintaining intimacy. In my work I photograph my belly. It has bad memories for me that I wanted to portray in photographs.
I use harsh light and shadows in my photographs, and the reason for this is because it is a bad memory and a difficult time. It was cruelty.
I felt a little insecure when taking the photographs and it was hard for me. At the same time, I think I was able to empathize with the old memory, rise above it and move on with my life.

### Amalia Ulman
The last author is Amalia Ulman. Amalia inspired me with the idea of showing a photo that is not real and that catches the eye on social media more than the ordinary reality. While creating this photograph, it became more apparent to me how bad things are today. On the internet we can hardly tell what is reality and what is not.
